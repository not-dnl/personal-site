# personal-site
* Small website of mine.
* Using [docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [traefik](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/) which handles ssl, redirects, subdomains etc.
* Each service has its own docker container and traefik basically handles the rest.

#### TODO
* Add [mailcow](https://mailcow.email/) to host my own email provider.
